# UI Automation Framework

This project is a scalable **UI Test Automation Framework** built using **Java and Selenium WebDriver**.  
It is designed following industry best practices with a focus on **maintainability, readability, and reusability**.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a robust and scalable UI automation framework that:

- Supports clean and maintainable test architecture
- Implements best practices in UI test automation
- Provides reliable and reusable test components
- Can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- Maven
- Page Object Model (POM)
- TestNG *(Update if you use JUnit instead)*
- GitHub Actions (CI Integration)

---

## 🏗 Framework Design

The framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to:

- Separate UI locators from test logic
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve test maintainability
- Increase code readability
